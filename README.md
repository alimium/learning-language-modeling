# Learning about Language Modeling and Prediciton on Sequential Data

This is my road to learning about transformers and SOTA language models. It closely resembles [karpathy / makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) and is based on [@karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy)'s YouTube videos with just a few minor changes and tweaks to match my personal learning preferences. Let's hope for an innovation 🤞🏻
